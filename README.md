# Arduino class to support MCP23008 8-bit port expander

Design Goals: This library is designed to:

* create a high level MCP23008 8-bit port expander class
* hide some of the details of MCP23008 implementation
* implement the interrupt capabilities of the chip
* learn how to use the I2C bus

Based on the great work by Adafruit and others!
